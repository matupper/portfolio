# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2025-12-28

Welcome to my _new blog_ about my personal dev journey! Here, I want to share my journey of exploring development and engineering with the goal of breaking in to computer graphics. To start, I wanted to build this site where I can document and journal my progress as well as show off any projects or demos I come to make in the future.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, to get started I created a new Astro Project (This site) to finally have a proper portfolio put together as I get ready to apply for "real" jobs and jumpstart my proffesional career.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned the very basics of Astro, creating different Pages for my site. This is done by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `src/pages/` directory.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post! I plan to make more of these markdown blog posts in the future to catalogue what I have been working on.

## What's next

So far, I have been following [this great tutotrial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) on Astro. I plan to finish this tutorial and to felsh out my personal portfolio site.
